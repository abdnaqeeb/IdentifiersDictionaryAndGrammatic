## Variables

Variable name differ based on its type and scope.

### General Rules



### Types

A variable can be defined in different types:
1. Primitive type
2. Class type

#### Number type

A number variable can present:
- Count
- Index
- Measurement

Many developers use the word "number" as part of the variable name to hold the count of something. For example a variable hold the count of students may have a name like `studentsNumber` or `numberOfStudents`. 

Actually we recommend to avoid using the `number` word in such ways, because it misleads in some occasions. Let us take a couple of examples. `serialNumber` is a string variable used as an Identification of a product. `packageNumber` is more misleading because it can mean the count of packages or the serial number of the package.

We recommend to use `count` instead of `number`. For example `packagesCount` is a variable holding the count of packages, and `studentsCount` is for the count of students.
#### String type


#### Boolean type

1. Global
2. Class object field
3. Class object property
4. Function local
5. Function argument
6. Function parameter
7. Loop index
8. Loop iterator
