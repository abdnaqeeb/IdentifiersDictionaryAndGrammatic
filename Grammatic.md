## Variables

Variable name differ based on its type and scope.

### General Rules



### Types

A variable can be defined in different types:
1. Primitive type
2. Class type

#### Number type

A number variable can present:
- Count
- Index
- Measurement

Many developers use the word "number" as part of the variable name stands for count of something. For example a variable hold the count of students may has a name like `studentsNumber` or `numberOfStudents`. We recommend to avoid using the `number` word such way, because it misleads when it comes in a variable like `serialNumber` or `packageNumber`, in those two example variables they do not represent a numeric value, instead usually `serialNumber` is a string contains many digits and sometimes string characters, `packageNumber` is more misleading because it can mean the count of packages or the serial number of package.


#### String type

1. Global
2. Class object field
3. Class object property
4. Function local
5. Function argument
6. Function parameter
7. Loop index
8. Loop iterator
9. Loop local
